-  ...
","well, how about everything... except the planning.

I got totally thrown off by the very short, few words recall / response to the open question. 
I am myself personally very much oversharing, overexplaining... and I am used to people talking plenty to me. But I did not see coming how I would stumble over being given very short answer. I was not able to adapt and find a segway to my planned questions. I got stuck in trying to get the suspect to talk more freely. Somewhat waisted time (?) and on top of that I lost track of time.
However I believe learned at least that there were plenty of discrepancies, since the answers I got were not consistent with the evidence. But I never got around to address that properly. I was dancing around too much with open questions. Well, it got me information to further pursue, even information to assume inconsistencies. But I missed to adress this within the time limit. Again, I believe I stood in my own way, being a bit over-aware in this situation regarding being unaccusatory and open, usually I am pretty unapologetically direct.

But, because the training emphasised on not applying pressure (which the mentioning of witnesses definetely would), I decided not to mention it. I kept the questions quite open. 

Performance: I followed my planned structure quite well, but I decided not to ask further questions about the suspects activity at Walter and Sons because I got a bit confused about its connection to the library mentioned by the suspect. As it was my first interview with the suspect in this investigation, I did not want to risk their cooperation this early by showing my inattention or contradicting them. ","I would like to have kept the interview more naturally structured, as I jumped between subjects quite unnaturally at times. I am also unsure about the ending, where the suspect stated that they did not know why they were a suspect, whether I should have informed them about it (which I think would be appropriate in a real interview) or just ended the interview like I did. Because of my limited knowledge and information, I did not want to risk their cooperation by telling them about the witnesses and footage, but I think that telling them something less pressuring would have been more appropriate than just leaving them.

I forgot to reinforce when she actually told me things that matched the evidence that was available. It could have helped her to want to tell more. I also would have liked to ask more focused questions like ""Was there anyone else in the basement?""
I think I accidentally asked some leading questions, so I would have liked to take my time when formulating questions at the moment. So if I'm feeling stressed, I think it's better to say ""Let me think for a second"". Instead of accidentally asking a leading question.

I felt i did not get the opportunity to really do an investigative interview. Mostly because of how he answered but i felt we had some trouble communicating as well.


","I dont think i personally could really have done anything differently other than maybe ending it earlier for my own sake. this is because i felt increasingly uncomfortable. i felt my suspect was condescending towards me and laughing at me in a way. 
i also felt i got almost angry at him for the way he handled the interview but in my head i couldnt do anything as i was not supposed to put any pressure on him but i didnt know the middle ground between saying that he really did not make any sense and not being rude about it. maybe i could have found a better way to tell him he wasnt making sense at all.
I am sad because i feel like i did my best and then it was hard to be but in a situation where i felt i had no control at al, it made me feel powerless which was not pleasant. "

I have a few conclusions:
- its difficult!! interviewing a total stranger about a handful of information about an unknown place is very difficult.
- collecting information, when you dont really know what exactly, is also difficult.
- Also I am way to polite I think? I lost my edge - above situation makes me apparently very un-confrontative and careful. First I thought i was overthinking the raining tips, now i thinks its just being ""unprepared""/not used to/ outside comfort zone with the situation.
- the lack of details and depth of information makes asking follow up questions diffcult, at least as i experienced it, since there is nothing more to say than ""there is cctv"". It feels shallow.
- Having no preconceived assumption makes leading the interview difficult. Having an assumption (on paper) and having that met by a stranger is confusing. :) 
- I wish at least the relation of the suspect to the Inc. in question would have been known. Or other background information to have kind of a place to put them in ... you know, I guess I want to have a start assumption to get confused by later:) 
- more info on timeline, cctv timestamps maybe and day of the week, could have made a little difference and an opportunity to ask more detailed maybe. (less shallow)

It felt easier to follow through with the plan this time but still let the interview run its cause. I also during the interview used the shift-of-strategy approach where I told the suspect if the statement lined up with the evidence. ","I feel like I sometimes rushed my next question when I thought the suspect had finished but it was only a little paus so I may have missed som information. "

This was done to get an answer out of the suspect regarding a question but this may have to lead to false memory re-creation.

Another aspect which I felt was a misstep was that I asked the suspect about their relation with the murderer, when they didn't know who the murderer was.

Lastly, I could have asked more concrete questions in a more direct way to get more substantial answers.
