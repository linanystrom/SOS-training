This was to try and force them to rush through their questions and to not dwell on any of my answers for too long at a time. I brought this up again later while the interview was looking through their notes to try and create urgency and not allow them additional time to think.

I didn't want to lie completely to the interviewer as if they had concrete evidence that I had taken a particular action or been in a certain area they might have been able to catch me in a lie. I tried to give a little bit of truth in terms of certain areas that I had been, the basement, the balcony, the 5th floor, and tried to create a reasonable excuse for why I had been there. I also tried to remain vague and hazy in my memory about specific details so that if a line of questioning was followed up on I would be able to feign confusion or claim I had made a mistake.

I denied knowledge of technology and politics when asked, I felt this could be risky as it might raise suspicion slightly but alternatively, admitting to this could immediately put the interview into a guilty mindframe.

I promised to make myself available over the next few days and offered details that would take time to check, knowing that I would not be returning and that although my story may not hold up on further inspection, I may be believed to be innocent in the moment and so I would not be held immediately for further interrogation.",1,"When the interviewer seemed to be sceptical I tried to be even more friendly, appear even more ""open and honest"" , and take a bit more time over some answers to make it seem as if I was genuinely having to recollect something that didn't stand out as important in my mind.",4,2,3,4,3,4,4,5,3,4,5,2,6,34,1,MC3A
