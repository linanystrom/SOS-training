It was got into though as time went by and so one started to BS one's way through it, with what was hopefully a plausible story.

That said some parts of the scenario didn't make sense as given all the stuff that you had done why wouldn't you just leg it when the security guard appeared?

If that wasn't an option because the building had been locked down etc then security has no right to detain you unless they make a citizens arrest because they suspect you of committing a crime.

That wasn't stated though and if it had been you had better believe that nothing would have been said to security.

If security had called the cops and the police had then made an arrest, then a lawyer would have been asked for and then a ""no comment"" interview would have been given instead of the BS tale that was spun. No good comes from talking to law enforcement.

Also as somebody who has been arrested and interviewed under caution this whole study was akin to a bad trip. 

It was only for trivial BS, a bit of weed etc, back in another life, but it's not a fun experience so at first this study brought back some bad memories.",2,No the same BS tale was spun throughout.

So at the outset I explained to the interviewer that I was feeling emotional and a little troubled, and that I had had some alcohol to drink (which is always great for reasonable doubt)

Initially I did not know how much detail the interviewer had, but the moment I realised that he did have access to CCTV footage, I knew that it was imperative for me to preempt some of his questions. This also meant that it was important for me to give an accurate account of the locations I went to in the building since the interviewer had knowledge of that. I also knew that I was wearing gloves the entire time, so my hopes were that the video footage would have been a little inconclusive, and I knew that my finger prints would have not been found on the items, which would have assisted in the reasonable doubt case (hopefully). 

In my efforts to preempt his questions, I explained my actions in great detail, by and adding emotive language to my responses in order to seem more believable. 

I also admitted to performing other unpalatable activities (like the blackmail and the drinking on the job), to throw the scent off of my actual criminal activities; it also provided a reasonable basis for my anxious behaviour if I exhibited it at any point. 

Because of the line of work I am in, I am very aware about the strategic importance of the way information is presented. So I took some of that, the bias that comes from the fact that I am a woman and less likely to perform criminal activity, and my desire to win, to drive my case ",1,"The strategy did not change, but the way I presented my information changed to be in line with with information he had.
